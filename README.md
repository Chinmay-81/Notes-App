# Notes-App <br>
# =========
<br> 

## In today’s fast-paced learning environment, access to structured study material is crucial. That's why I built Notes-App, a platform where students can easily find and access notes for different subjects. 📚✨
<br>

### Features of Notes-App:
1.User Authentication & Email Verification: Users must sign up using Gmail, and a verification email is sent via Java Mail Sender. Only after verifying their identity can they log in. 🛡️✉️<br>
2.Secure Password Storage: All passwords are stored in an encrypted format using Spring Security. 🔒<br>
3.Find Notes for Any Subject: After login, users can access various subject notes and even browse college-wise notes (coming soon). 🎓📖<br>
4.Google Drive API Integration: Notes are stored in Google Drive, and users can view PDFs seamlessly using PDF.js with pagination and proper aspect ratio handling. 🔍📄<br>
5.Dynamic Search & Navigation: A smart search bar allows users to quickly find and access their required notes with smooth redirection. ⚡<br>
